# After the Workshop

We hope that the workshop provides a jumping off point for participants to create or enrich data science curricula at their home institutions, and we want to continue to support these efforts well after the workshop closes! To do so, we have prepared a list of opportunities for future collaborations between participants and Harvard IACS:

1. **[ComputeFest](https://www.computefest.seas.harvard.edu) (JANUARY 19 - 22, 2021):** IACS ComputeFest is four days of advanced applied deep learning workshops led by IACS researchers, students, alumni, and industry presenters. Participants of the IACS Pedagogy Workshop will be automatically registered for ComputeFest and their ***registration fee will be waived***. ComputeFest is an opportunity for participants to further develop their familiarity with data science models (particularly neural network models), tools and applications.

2. **[Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon and Conference](https://www.widsconference.org) (JANUARY 1 - MARCH 8, 2021):** The Women in Data Science (WiDS) initiative aims to inspire and educate data scientists worldwide, regardless of gender, and to support women in the field. WiDS includes:<br>
    - A conference with 150+ regional events worldwide in more than 60 countrie.
    - A datathon, encouraging participants to hone their data science skills by tackling a data science challenge with important social impact. 
    
    The WiDS datathon is particularly useful for driving student engagement and providing extra-curricular enrichment for data science students. We encourage IACS Pedagogy Workshop participants to consider hosting WiDS events at their home institutions catering to their own students. For example, we encourage participants to consider hosting a WiDS Datathon Workshop to help students at their home institutions enter the WiDS datathon. The [Cambridge WiDS Datathon Workshop](https://onefishy.github.io/wids_datathon_2020/) is happy to provide templates and materials for creating your own workshop, we are also happy to host students from participant home institutions at the 2021 Cambridge WiDS Datathon Workshop (the workshop will be held virtually in early February). 

3. **Spring Research Visit (MARCH - MAY, 2021):** For those participants who are interested, IACS offers a number of possible spring programming for participant home institutions, ranging from introduction to data science workshops for students to research talks from IACS researchers. We are especially enthusiastic to brainstorm with participants on how to use such programming to help support students from historically minoritized backgrounds in data science!

Finally, we intent for the workshop to pave the way for many fruitful future exchanges of ideas and collaborations between participants as well as between participants and IACS. As such, we encourage participants to stay in touch with each other and ourselves - we are happy to support your future endeavours in any way we can!
