# What will you do at the workshop?
The workshop consists of 5 days of data science/machine learning tutorials followed by team-based practical sessions, with a focus on developing effective data science pedagogy. 

In this workshop:
1.  you will be introduced to fundamental as well as "state-of-the-art" data science/machine learning concepts and methods
2.  you will get hands-on experience implementing data science methodology and machine learning models
3.  you will connect and work with data science educators from different institutions across the US
4.  you will develop materials for data science pedagogy. You will create a syllabus and lesson plans for a data science course as well as homework assignments and projects ideas customized to the needs of your students and your home institution 

Workshop participants will also receive free admission to Harvard IACS's annual ComputeFest (taking place right after the workshop). At ComputeFest, participants have opportunities to participate in additional data science workshops and seminars as well as make connections with many Boston area universities and tech industries.
