# Day 1 (Jan 4th) Discussion Highlights

The following are some of the questions that came up during the afternoon discussion section:

1. How do we attract students to data science courses? How do we get prospective students excited about data science?
2. How do we find relevant datasets and data science tasks for specific majors and interest groups (e.g. biologists, engineers, business students etc)? Are there good public repositories of usable data and well defined tasks that I can use as inspiration/reference for my course?
3. How do we find good resources to support us teaching data visualization and story telling (important components of a data scientist's job), especially if we, the instructors, do not have specialized training in such fields?
4. If we find ourselves to be the only one (or one of few) data science instructors at our home institution, how do we offer curricular and extra-curricular support to our students without taking on an impossible additional workload? Are there existing programs for mentorship, extra-curricular enrichment, professional organizations that our students can plug into and sustain without a huge amount of faculy supervision?
5. How do we teach data science in a way that is accessible? In a data science course aiming to produce informed laypeople, how much of the math and programming can we abstract away while still ensuring that our students walk away with a meaningful and practical understanding of data science? 
6. When we design a general education data science course, what should be the minimum pre-requisite? What about a follow-up courser in data science?
7. How do we make sure that what we are teaching in our data science courses are standardized content (i.e. we are covering more or less what other institutions are covering in these courses)? How do we make sure that what we are teaching in our data science courses are useful in industry (i.e. how to make sure that we are meeting industry standards)?
8. We live in a time where companies like Google, IBM and Microsoft are releasing free pedagogical materials on data science and machine learning or offering certificate programs. What can we offer that is different and complementary as academic data science educators? 
9. When we are asking our students to engage with broader social impact and ethical dimensions of technical problems, or when we ask them to develop skills in communication and story-telling how do we grade assignments that incorporate these elements? How do we develop grading rubrics that evaluate communication skills or narrative skills that is both fair to the student and does not impose an impossible burden on the instructor (especially in institutions where instructors may not have access to graders)?
10. Group projects sound great in theory but how can we make group projects work for students who are parents or part-time/full-time workers?
11. A big part of helping students find their way in data science is to help them build professional connections, towards this end, how can we build a alumni network of data science graduates who can be resources to current students making career decisions? In what creative ways can we get our alumni involved in building an active and self-sustaining data science environment?
