# Before the Workshop: Preparing for the Workshop

It would be helpful for participants to have some familiarity in `python` programming. You can familiarize yourself with `python` by completing online tutorials, for example: [https://www.learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org). In particular, it's helpful for participants to be able to manipulate data using `pandas` `DataFrames`, perform basic operations with `numpy` Arrays and make use of basic plotting functions (e.g. line chart, histogram, scatter plot, bar chart) from `matplotlib`:
1. [`pandas` Basics](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Pandas_Basics)
2. [`numpy` Basics](https://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
3. [`matplotlib` Basics](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/matplotlib-tutorial-python)

For this workshop, we will be using [DeepNote](https://deepnote.com/) - a free cloud computing service that comes with pre-installed machine learning tools. Deepnote allows you to easily work on your data science projects, together in real-time and in one place with your friends and colleagues. It allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. You can familiarize yourself with the interface of DeepNote notebooks by reading the following tutorials (remember you don't need to install anything!):

1. [Deepnote: the modern way to teach Data Science](https://medium.com/@robertlacok/deepnote-the-modern-way-to-teach-data-science-99998ce659a)
2. [Deepnote: Documentation](https://docs.deepnote.com/)

Finally, we will be working with random variables in this workshop and will be reasoning about them through their distributions. But we'll only need a bit of familiarity with these concepts:

1. [Probability distributions in python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/probability-distributions-python)

## Skills Check for Participants
You might find the following Deepnote notebook useful to get a sense of the types of computational tasks that we will be using during the workshop

[Introduction to Deepnote Notebook and `python` Libraries for Data Science](https://deepnote.com/project/92d5bb62-1707-4095-b837-794234097fd6)

**Instructions:** 
1. Open the notebook,Â  under the drop-down menu by the name of the project, `0-preparing-for-the-workshop`, choose to Duplicate the project. The copy will open in the same tab.
2. If you want to share your work with others: under 'Share' (upper right-hand side of your screen), change the permissions to "Public access: On" and share the link, or invite specific collaborators.
