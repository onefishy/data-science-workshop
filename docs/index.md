# General Information
This is a week long data science pedagogy workshop for educators of underrepresented or underserved college students in data
science. The workshop is ***virtual*** and will take place **January 10-14, 2022**. There is no cost for participation.

The goals of the workshop are to: 
1. help educators, who are new to the field, build sound foundations in data science
2. expose data science educators to "state-of-the-art" methodologies and tools in data science
3. facilitate a supportive environment for educators to develop data science pedagogical materials that are customized to the needs of their own students. 

### Organizers

This workshop is organized by the [Institute of Applied Computational Sciences](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu) at Harvard University. 

The program committee:
- [Weiwei Pan](https://onefishy.github.io) (Harvard IACS)
- [Pavlos Protopapas](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/people/pavlos-protopapas) (Harvard IACS)

### Workshop Schedule
The workshop structure is based on the format of a “flipped-classroom”. We ask that participants review the technical content (videos, slides etc) prior to each day, and work on hands-on activities during workshop sessions. There will be two workshop sessions per day. Each session will consist of hands-on activities centering around content exploration or pedagogy.

**Morning Sessions:** Participants will explore Deepnote notebooks that combine data science concepts together in ways that expose interesting properties.

**Afternoon Session:** Participants will discuss how to adapt existing materials or how to create new materials for teaching data science concepts to their own students.
